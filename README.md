## Cool Doggo

Cool Doggo wasn’t just any dog—he was the coolest doggo in town. Whether he was skateboarding down the boardwalk, catching frisbees mid-air, or charming café-goers with his impeccable manners, everyone knew Cool Doggo. He had a swagger in his step and a wag in his tail that made even the grumpiest of passersby crack a smile.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
